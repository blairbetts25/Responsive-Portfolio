            <p>
                Greetings my name is Blair Betts and I am a current student of the UNC BootCamp program. I am a graduate
                from UNC Greensboro with a bachelors degree in communication studies. During my time at UNCG I also
                played
                baseball. Being a former collegiate athlete I am familar with the defintion of hard work and adveristy.
                I
                ehanced my time management skills as well as drive to be a perfectionist. While I understand perfection
                may
                not alwasys be achievable that is always the goal that I strive for. This is a trait that I took with me
                as
                I began my collegiate coaching career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baseball however is just one demtion about me. I was rasied by a programmer and a music teacher so I
                have
                some creativity about me as well. I pursued my musical talents through high school and still revert back
                those skills ocasionaly. Having this mindset I tend to see things a little differently than normal. I'll
                constentally break things down but then give them my own little twist to them.
            </p>
